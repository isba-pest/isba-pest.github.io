In 1985 I started with shito ryu karate which I was doing for two years. In 1987 I was on my first jûjutsu training because of the recommendation of my friend. I participate my first training camp in 1989 on Martely, and here was my first belt exam to yellow belt (5.kyu) in front of Shihan István Kelemen.
In these times we had hard trainings in a gym of an elementary school in Miskolc.</description></item><item><title>shihan Jun Osano</title><link>/en/jun-osano/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/jun-osano/</guid><description>A living legend: our grandmaster Jun Osano Nihon Jûjutsu 8.dan.
Whose practicing japanese martial arts may know this words: men kyo kaiden.
In the old japanese schools wasn’t dan levels. The student from a few years of practicing got shoden (lower level) at first, and after came the chuden (middle level). If the student was persisdent enough, the master wrote a MEN KYO KAIDEN roll – certificating with this that all of the knowledge is his own from that ryu (school), and he has the rights to teach it by grandmaster.</description></item></channel></rss>
