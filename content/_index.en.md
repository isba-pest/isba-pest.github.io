## Our philisophy


Why are you train?

Actually it's about the different level of motivation, knowledge and maturity.

All starts with the selfdefence. Almost everybody goes down to a training because he/she would like to defend himself/herself.

After he/she learned the basics and already train for a while, looking for confirmation and the possibility for envolving, proof, try out himself/herself on different fighting competition.

Then later when he/she already learned to win and loose, the strength, technique and spirit became an important thing, he/she will be a martial artist.
